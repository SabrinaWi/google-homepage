First tentative try at building a web page. See www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

So, basically this is about getting a feeling for positioning and basic structure of a web page. It is not about including all of the functionality of the real Google homepage. 

I might have to cut this short as DH and I are due for a "staycation" from Sept 7 till Sept 20. I don't want to return to this after 2 weeks of not working on it, so I'll move right on to the difficult version of the challenge afterwards (recreate a Google search page), which should be a good way to get back into things.
